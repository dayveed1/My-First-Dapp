# My-First-Dapp
My Journey To Blockchain Development

# I was able to create a simple ethereum dapp with etherjs by :

Creating a basic html web page

Creating a basic solidity smart contract and finally

Connecting the web page with the smart contracts using Ethersjs.

For this project i used https://metamask.io/, https://remix.ethereum.org/, https://code.visualstudio.com/ and https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/.
