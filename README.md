# My-First-Dapp
My Journey To Blockchain Development

# I was able to create a simple ethereum dapp with etherjs by :

Creating a basic html web page

Creating a basic solidity smart contract and finally

Connecting the web page with the smart contracts using Ethersjs.

For this project i used [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Ethersjs](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/).

Thank you!
